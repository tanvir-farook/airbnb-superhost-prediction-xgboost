# 🏠 Airbnb Superhost Prediction using XGBoost

This project explores what factors influence a listing’s chances of achieving *Superhost* status on Airbnb. Using a combination of feature engineering, data cleaning, and machine learning (XGBoost), we build a predictive model that achieves 97–98% accuracy in classifying Superhost listings.

🔍 **Key Highlights:**
- Data preprocessing with missing value imputation and outlier capping  
- Feature importance analysis with XGBoost  
- Classification model built and evaluated in Python  
- Real-world application of machine learning for business insights  

This is an end-to-end project demonstrating how advanced analytics can be used to support business growth and improve listing performance.
